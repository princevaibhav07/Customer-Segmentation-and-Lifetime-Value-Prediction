# Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Prediction & Segmentation

## Objective:

The goal of this project is to predict the Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) and segment customers based on their predicted CLV. This information will help optimize marketing campaigns and cost-per-acquisition (CPA) strategies.

## Introduction:

For this project, we use a dataset sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains transactional data from a UK-based e-commerce retail store specializing in unique all-occasion gifts. The dataset includes features such as Invoice Number, Stock Code, Product Description, Quantity, Invoice Date, Unit Price, and Customer ID, among others.

Before we dive into model development, it’s essential to understand the concept of Customer Lifetime Value (CLV).

### What is Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)?

Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) is a key metric that estimates the total revenue a business can expect from a customer throughout the entire duration of their relationship. CLV helps businesses understand the long-term value of customers, as opposed to just the value from a single purchase. This metric is crucial for determining an appropriate cost for acquiring customers and understanding their true worth to the company.

Tracking CLV is important because retaining existing customers typically costs less than acquiring new ones. Therefore, increasing CLV through customer retention strategies can significantly drive business growth.

### Why is CLV Important?
CLV provides marketers with insights into how much revenue they can expect from a customer over the course of their relationship. As customers continue purchasing over time, their CLV increases. By tracking CLV, businesses can optimize their marketing efforts and ensure they are targeting customers who provide the most value.

### CLV Calculation Methods:
There are various methods to calculate CLV. For this project, I’ll explain the model I used and why it was chosen. Understanding the business context is critical before selecting the appropriate CLV calculation model.

## Business Context:
There are two main types of customer relationships that affect CLV calculations:

### Contractual: In this context, businesses have a defined period in which customers are expected to churn. These are subscription-based relationships where customers sign contracts, and businesses can predict when a customer will leave. Examples include Netflix, Hotstar, and Amazon Prime subscriptions.

### Non-Contractual: In non-contractual businesses, customers can leave at any time without notice. These relationships are more challenging to model, especially in industries like retail and e-commerce.

## Types of Purchase Opportunities:

### Continuous: Customers make regular, ongoing purchases, which makes it easier to predict their future behavior.

### Discrete: Purchases are made at specific intervals or during particular events. This is more common in subscription-based businesses.

### For this project, we are dealing with a non-contractual and continuous business model, such as e-commerce, where customers make frequent, irregular purchases.

## Purpose of the Research:

This study aims to estimate the potential revenue (CLV) generated by active customers in a non-contractual-continuous business setting. To achieve this, we use probabilistic models such as Pareto-NBD, BG-NBD, MBG-NBD, and Gamma-Gamma. We also employ unsupervised machine learning techniques for customer segmentation to help in strategic planning.

## Steps Involved:

Data Importing: Import the dataset for analysis.

Data Cleaning: Handle missing data and remove any inconsistencies.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze and visualize the data to understand patterns and relationships.

Feature Engineering/Extraction: Create new features from the raw data that will help improve model performance.

Cross-Validation: Validate models to ensure their robustness and accuracy.

Predictive Model Building: Develop models to predict CLV, including probabilistic models.

LTV-Based Customer Segmentation: Segment customers based on their predicted CLV for targeted marketing strategies.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the models using appropriate metrics.

Model Deployment: Deploy the model for use in real-world applications.

## Libraries Used:

Scikit-Learn: For machine learning algorithms and model evaluation.

Lifetimes: For building CLV prediction models.

Plotly, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Altair: For data visualization.

XLRD: For reading Excel files.

Streamlit: For building interactive dashboards.

Numpy, Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

Datetime, Math: For handling date and time calculations.
